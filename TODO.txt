# Working

+ Fix issue with parsing Info.*Date fields
+ Send PR to CF-Extensions project when identified w/o .cf-extensions file rather than commit
+ Move `status` info from repos to cf-extensions and use link instead (prevents owners from changing it)

+ Add integration test

+ Create CF app to periodically run cf-extensions project to update all CF-Extensions projects and resulting projects.json DB
+ Look for CF-Extensions projects from cloudfoundry-incubator and other orgs (e.g., cloudfoundry-community, cloudfoundry, etc)

+ Move this code to the cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-extensions
+ Delete this repo

# Done

- Only commit projects.json if it is different than current one
- Create simple Markdown UI file to display content of the projects.json
- When a cf-extensions repo is deleted then regenerate the projects.json and projects.md files
- Refactor code with main() and add bin/build
- Add some simple tests and bin/test
- Create presentation and share with IBM team then community
- Remove hard coded github auth token and org
