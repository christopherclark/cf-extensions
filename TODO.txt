# Done

- Only commit projects.json if it is different than current one
- Create simple Markdown UI file to display content of the projects.json
- When a cf-extensions repo is deleted then regenerate the projects.json and projects.md files
- Refactor code with main() and add bin/build
- Add some simple tests and bin/test
- Create presentation and share with IBM team then community
- Remove hard coded github auth token and org
- Add proposal docs link to Info
- Add logo/icon to Info
- Look into generating GitHub pages or wiki for projects summary
- Send an issue to repos without .cf-extensions but that have topics
- Add basic repo statistics, e.g., likes, followers, forks, commits, contributors
- Avoid duplicating issue for info if already sent and open
- Add links to latest and previous releases (if exist)
- Iterate over pages for issue search code
- Remove unnecessary fields in .cf-extensions Info, i.e., name, status, status_date_changed
- Move `status` info from repos to cf-extensions and use link instead (prevents owners from changing it)
- Create list of untracked_projects.json for projects that do not have statuses
- Email to Dr.Nick on how to create ext.cloudfoundry.org and point it to: https://cloudfoundry-incubator.github.io/cf-extensions/
- Move this code to the cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-extensions
- Delete this private repo
- Write blog post (containing parts of README) to be published on CloudFoundry.org
- Move issue template to a template file
