# Working

+ Avoid duplicating issue for info if already sent and open
+ Remove unnecessary fields in .cf-extensions Info, i.e., name, status, status_date_changed
+ Move `status` info from repos to cf-extensions and use link instead (prevents owners from changing it)

+ Fix issue with parsing Info.*Date fields

+ Add more details to project's README.md
+ Add links or preview to README.md of CF-Extensions process and template

+ add HTML anchors to generated pages

+ Move this code to the cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-extensions
+ Delete this repo

+ Update CF-Extensions project presentation for Monday 7/31 call and record
+ Add links to presentation and recording to README.md

+ Add integration test

+ Create CF app to periodically run cf-extensions project to update all CF-Extensions projects and resulting projects.json DB
+ Look for CF-Extensions projects from cloudfoundry-incubator and other orgs (e.g., cloudfoundry-community, cloudfoundry, etc)

# Future

+ Send PR to CF-Extensions project when identified w/o .cf-extensions file rather than issue
+ Periodically clean up forked projects created for PRs

# Done

- Only commit projects.json if it is different than current one
- Create simple Markdown UI file to display content of the projects.json
- When a cf-extensions repo is deleted then regenerate the projects.json and projects.md files
- Refactor code with main() and add bin/build
- Add some simple tests and bin/test
- Create presentation and share with IBM team then community
- Remove hard coded github auth token and org
- Add proposal docs link to Info
- Add logo/icon to Info
- Look into generating GitHub pages or wiki for projects summary
- Send an issue to repos without .cf-extensions but that have topics
