# Working

+ Add lead_github_id to required info for projects (instead of contact, assuming I can get email from github ID)
+ Add slack_channel to optional info for projects

+ Update latest go-github and use Topics from new code instead of fork
+ Fix issue with parsing Info.*Date fields

+ Add some integration test and basic CI

+ Look for CF-Extensions projects from cloudfoundry-incubator and other orgs (e.g., cloudfoundry-community, cloudfoundry, etc)
+ Create cf-extensions-bot GitHub user with access to all cloudfoundry orgs and switch to using that

+ Add check for Snyk security scanning and latest scan and note in project info and lists

+ Add links or preview to README.md of CF-Extensions process and template
+ add HTML anchors to generated pages
+ Update CF-Extensions project presentation for CAB call Wednesday 8/16 call and record
+ Add links to CAB August presentation and recording to README.md

# Future

+ Send PR to CF-Extensions project when identified w/o .cf-extensions file rather than issue
+ Periodically clean up forked projects created for PRs

# Done

- Only commit projects.json if it is different than current one
- Create simple Markdown UI file to display content of the projects.json
- When a cf-extensions repo is deleted then regenerate the projects.json and projects.md files
- Refactor code with main() and add bin/build
- Add some simple tests and bin/test
- Create presentation and share with IBM team then community
- Remove hard coded github auth token and org
- Add proposal docs link to Info
- Add logo/icon to Info
- Look into generating GitHub pages or wiki for projects summary
- Send an issue to repos without .cf-extensions but that have topics
- Add basic repo statistics, e.g., likes, followers, forks, commits, contributors
- Avoid duplicating issue for info if already sent and open
- Add links to latest and previous releases (if exist)
- Iterate over pages for issue search code
- Remove unnecessary fields in .cf-extensions Info, i.e., name, status, status_date_changed
- Move `status` info from repos to cf-extensions and use link instead (prevents owners from changing it)
- Create list of untracked_projects.json for projects that do not have statuses
- Email to Dr.Nick on how to create ext.cloudfoundry.org and point it to: https://cloudfoundry-incubator.github.io/cf-extensions/
- Move this code to the cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-extensions
- Delete this private repo
- Write blog post (containing parts of README) to be published on CloudFoundry.org
- Move issue template to a template file
- Add more details to project's README.md
- Add category tag field to Info with specified defaults: BOSH, Runtime, APIs, CLI
- Add commit_type field (pairing or distributed) to the Info of projects
- Make the .cf-extensions metadata file format be either JSON or YML
- Add `dep` support and commit current dependencies
- Use go vet in build script
- Change owner_company to lead_company
- Use go-flags to parse command line options
- Create CF app to periodically run cf-extensions project to update all CF-Extensions projects and resulting projects.json DB
- Implement Verbose option so that only necessary info is shown in output and all others only when verbost is on
