# Working

+ Fix issue with parsing Info.*Date fields

+ Send PR to CF-Extensions project when identified w/o .cf-extensions file rather than commit
+ Move `status` info from repos to cf-extensions and use link instead (prevents owners from changing it)

+ Look into generating GitHub pages or wiki for projects summary

+ Add integration test

+ Create CF app to periodically run cf-extensions project to update all CF-Extensions projects and resulting projects.json DB
+ Look for CF-Extensions projects from cloudfoundry-incubator and other orgs (e.g., cloudfoundry-community, cloudfoundry, etc)

+ Add more details to project's README.md
+ Add links or preview to README.md of CF-Extensions process and template

+ Move this code to the cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-extensions
+ Delete this repo

+ Update CF-Extensions project presentation for Monday 7/31 call and record
+ Add links to presentation and recording to README.md
