# Working

3. Refactor code with main() and add bin/build
4. Add some simple tests and bin/test
5. Create presentation and share with IBM team then community
6. Remove hard coded github auth token
7. Move `status` info from repos to cf-extensions and use link instead (prevents owners from changing it)
8. Send PR to CF-Extensions project when identified w/o .cf-extensions file rather than commit
9. Create CF app to periodically run cf-extensions project to update all CF-Extensions projects and resulting projects.json DB
10. Look for CF-Extensions projects from cloudfoundry-incubator and other orgs (e.g., cloudfoundry-community, cloudfoundry, etc)
7. Move this code to the cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-extensions
8. Delete this repo

# Done
